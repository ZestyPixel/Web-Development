React controls form elements by setting their value via state and updating that state via event handlers. 
This allows React to have full control over the form data, making it easier to manage and validate user input.

useAffect() is a hook that lets you perform side effects in function components.
It takes two arguments: a function that contains the side effect code, and an optional array of dependencies that determine when the effect should re-run.

When using useAffect() with forms, you can perform actions such as fetching data when the component mounts, updating the document title based on form input, 
or validating form data whenever it changes.

If you put an empty array as the second argument to useAffect(), the effect will only run once when the component mounts.

IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.
