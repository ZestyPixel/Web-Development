States can only be passsed down from parent to child components. 

Design principles in react:
1. State desing pattern(Lifting state up): Lift the state up to the closest common ancestor of all components that need it.
2. Single source of truth: Maintain a single source of truth for shared state to ensure consistency across components.
3. Unidirectional data flow: Data flows in one direction, from parent to child components, making it easier to understand and debug.
4. Composition over inheritance: Use component composition to share behavior and state instead of relying on inheritance.

Types of components:
1. Functional components: These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements. 
    They are stateless and do not have lifecycle methods.
2. Class components: These are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They can have state and lifecycle methods. 
3. Logical components: These components are responsible for handling the logic and state management of the application. 
    They do not render any UI elements themselves but instead pass data and functions down to presentational components as props.
4. Presentational components: These components are primarily concerned with how things look. 
    They receive data and callbacks via props and render UI elements accordingly. They do not manage state or handle logic.

In js functions are first class objects. They can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
