React is writetn in jsx(JavaScript Extension Syntax) which is a syntax extension for JavaScript. 
It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of your UI components.
JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel before it can be executed 
by the browser.

Now, vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
It leverages native ES modules in the browser to provide a fast development server and uses Rollup for production builds.
Vite is designed to work seamlessly with frameworks like React, Vue, and others, providing features like hot module replacement (HMR),
fast refresh, and optimized builds out of the box.

Understanding the file structure of a Vite + React project:
1. The src folder contains the main source code for your application, including components, styles, and other assets.
2. The public folder contains static assets that are served directly without processing, such as images and fonts.
3. The index.html file is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your application.
4. The vite.config.js file is the configuration file for Vite, where you can customize various settings for your project.
5. The src file contains:
    1. main.jsx: The entry point for the React application, where the root component is rendered to the DOM.
    2. App.jsx: The main application component that serves as the root of your component tree.
    3. components/: A folder that typically contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
    4. assets/: A folder for storing images, styles, and other static assets used in the application.
    5. App.css: A CSS file for styling the App component and other global styles.

The basic flow is that app.jsx is the main component that gets rendered in main.jsx and index.html is where 
the root div is present where the react app gets mounted. 

In summary, named exports are uselful when you want to export multiple values and import them with their sepcific names,
while default exports are useful when you want to export a single value and giving it a specific custom name when importing.
The choice between the two depends on the structure and requirements of your module.

Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
Webpack allows you to bundle your JavaScript files along with other assets like CSS, images, and fonts into a single or multiple output files.
It provides features like code splitting, tree shaking, and hot module replacement to optimize the development and production workflow.

React props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. 
Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.
They allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of components by providing them with different values.
