<body>
    <video src = "Video.mp4" width = "500" height = "280" controls loop poster = "Thumbnail.jpg"></video>
    <audio src = "Audio.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>Some more attributes of video tag : <ul>
        <li>Autoplay</li>
        <li>Muted (Autoplay does not work without muted tag)</li>
        <li>Preload attribute(for audio) has three values :<ul>
            <li>None- The browser will not preload anything. The audio will download when the user initiates playback.</li>
            <li>metadata - the browser will preload metadata(duration,basic info). This is useful if you want to show the audio duration without
                loading the audio data.
            </li>
            <li>auto - The browser will preload the entire audio as much as possible without delaying the loading of other important page content.
                Its so that the audio is ready to play when the user wants.
            </li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul></p>
