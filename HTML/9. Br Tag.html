    <u><p><h1>The Door In The Dark</h1></u>
    <h2>By <i><b>Robert Frost</b></i></h2>
    <hr>
    In going from room to room in the dark,<br>
    I reached out blindly to save my face,<br>
    But neglected, however lightly, to lace<br>
    My fingers and close my arms in an arc.<br>
    A slim door got in past my guard,<br>
    And hit me a blow in the head so hard<br>
    I had my native simile jarred.<br>
    So people and things don't pair any more<br>
    With what they used to pair with before.
