//6 rules of thumb for mongodb relationships
// One: Favor embedding unless there is a compelling reason not to.

// Two: Needing to access an object on its own is a compelling reason not to embed it.

// Three: Arrays should not grow without bound. If there are more than a couple of hundred documents on the “many” side, don’t embed them; 
// if there are more than a few thousand documents on the “many” side, don’t use an array of ObjectID references. 
// High-cardinality arrays are a compelling reason not to embed.

// Four: Don’t be afraid of application-level joins: If you index correctly and use the projection specifier, 
// then application-level joins are barely more expensive than server-side joins in a relational database.

// Five: Consider the read-to-write ratio with denormalization. 
// A field that will mostly be read and only seldom updated is a good candidate for denormalization. 
// If you denormalize a field that is updated frequently then the extra work of finding and updating all the instances of redundant data is likely to 
// overwhelm the savings that you get from denormalization.

// Six: As always with MongoDB, how you model your data depends entirely on your particular application’s data access patterns. 
// You want to structure your data to match the ways that your application queries and updates it.
